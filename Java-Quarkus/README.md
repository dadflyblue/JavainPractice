# Java-Quarkus

This is my personal repository for learning the Java Quarkus framework. You can find instructions on how to build and run it in the [HowtoRun](HowtoRun.md) document. Quarkus is "A kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot and GraalVM, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards." If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: <https://quarkus.io/>.
